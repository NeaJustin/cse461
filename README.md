creating a file system that would replicated one such as Linux or Windows based OS. Each part containing things such as the sDisk for management of the Filesystem. Then the file system that would save the data and write to the blocks and allocate proper memory for that file. The Shell is then created in order to give users access to the delete, copy files, add files, and read/write options. Table was then implemented to simulate looking up for specific data within the file. All coming in together to create a file system that would work on linux and Windows Based OS.
